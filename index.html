    <h3>Our Purpose:</h3>
    <p title="Our Purpose">Our Main Goal is to create a view for everyone that coding is not only learned by geniuses. Everyone can and should be
        able to learn the art of coding. Here at the Computer Science club, our powerpoint instructors provide very entertaining and
        easy to learn criteria while at the same time giving a bold experience of Computer knowledge. With material made from
        the help of a professional programmer and experienced programmers, it delivers a productive and fun learning experience for everyone. 
        </p>
    <h3>Information:</h3>
    <p title="Information">We will post short powerpoints for Rancho through our Google Classroom(AccessCode: tbo1x79) on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  
        These quick powerpoints with small amounts of homework make it easy to learn python without spending too much time.
         If you have any questions or just want to come in to compare codes, come into our interactive coding club meetings on Friday. We hope to see you there! :)
        </p>
    
    
    <h3>Location and Time:</h3>
    <p title="Location and Time">Our school meeting is located at Rancho Middle School in Mrs. Gilpin's classroom(C4). The meeting will commence at 12:48 and end
